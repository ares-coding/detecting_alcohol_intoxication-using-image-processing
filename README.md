# Detecting Alcohol Intoxication Using Image Processing
> Coded by **Ares Coding**


An Android-based application that detects **alcohol intoxication from facial images** using image processing and machine learning techniques.  
This project analyzes facial cues to classify individuals as **Normal** or **Drunk**.

> 🎓 Developed as part of an academic research / thesis project.

## 📱 Project Overview

Alcohol intoxication affects facial expressions, eye behavior, and muscle control.  
This application captures facial images and processes them using trained machine learning models to determine intoxication status.

The main objective of this project is to explore the feasibility of detecting alcohol intoxication through **facial image analysis** and deploy the solution in a real Android environment.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📸 Capture facial images using an Android device camera  
- 🧠 Image processing for facial feature analysis  
- 📊 Classification result: **Normal** or **Drunk**  
- 📱 Successfully tested on a real Android device  
- 🧪 Experimental comparison of multiple ML models

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The system was trained and evaluated using the following models:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**  
- **Hybrid CNN–SVM Model**

The hybrid approach uses CNN for feature extraction and SVM for final classification to improve performance.
